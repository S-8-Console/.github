# S-8 Console

S-8 is an 8 bit fantasy console. Which means that it never existed fysically but you can emulate it. Like the PICO-8 console.

The S-8 Console project is aimed towards making an easily emulatable and understandable fantasy console. 

S-8 is unique because it only has RAM dedicated to the ROM (Sprite-rom and Game-rom)

This makes it a challanging platform to write games for, as you can only use registers to store variable data.
