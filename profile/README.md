# S-8 Console

S-8 is an 8 bit fantasy console. Which means that it never existed physically but you can emulate it. Like the PICO-8 console.

The S-8 Console project is aimed towards making an easily emulatable and understandable fantasy console. 
I want to target it towards people who are learning how emulation works (like me) 
, and to people who just want to play awesome games!

Currently, the project is in it's very early stages. I'm still making prototype emulators and LOTS is changing.

The aim is to give game developers enough freedom to express their creativity, 
but still make it a challenging platform to write games for.
